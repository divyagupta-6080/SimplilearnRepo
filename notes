#Linux commands
* You can use the following command to list instances with specific tags
/home/testuser/.local/bin/aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint-url http://localhost:3000/ --filters 'Name=tag-key,Values=cluster' 'Name=tag-value,Values="build,nginx"'
 
Problem Statement:
#From an inventory of instances in ec2, using a scripting language like
#python (boto) or ruby with aws sdk or BASH script:
1. List down instances which do not match a "cluster" tag with value "webserver".
2. Add a value in "cluster" tag with value "csv", idempotently.

ELKstack
Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine. It is used to store and index data from a variety of sources, including logs, events, and metrics.
Logstash is a tool for collecting and processing data from a variety of sources. It can be used to filter, transform, and enrich data before it is stored in Elasticsearch.
Kibana is a visualization tool that can be used to explore and analyze data stored in Elasticsearch. It can be used to create charts, graphs, and dashboards to help you understand your data
 
 
Code-commit- AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed, secure, private Git repository service that makes it easy for you to store and manage your code. CodeCommit eliminates the need to manage your own Git infrastructure, so you can focus on building great software.
 
Codedeploy Pipeline - AWS CodeDeploy Pipeline is a continuous delivery service that automates the process of deploying code changes to a variety of deployment targets, including Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, and Amazon ECS services.
 
Code build- AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration (CI) service that compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that can be used to deploy your application. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build infrastructure.


Code pipeline- AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code changes to a variety of deployment targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, and Amazon ECS services.
 
 
Elastic load balancer-
Clasic Load Balancer http, https, tcp,ssl
Network loadbalancer support tcp, UDP
Application loadbalancer http, https
gatwayLoad Balancer
 
CIDR- Classless Inter-domain Routing
is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets


Netmask- A netmask, also known as a network mask or subnet mask, is a 32-bit value that is used to identify the network and host portions of an IP address. The netmask is used by routers to determine how to route IP packets.
 
 
Kubernetes version differences
1.23. and 1.24
 
CRI- container runtime interface for docker (dockershim) deprecated.
CSI graduated to use stable version
Dynamic kublet config removed
Master naode lalable won’t be available on control plane
Valumesnapshot CRD- custom resource definition
 
 
 
Docker build and compose
Docker build is used to create a docker image
Docker-compose is used to run the docker image with service configuration
 
EBS type volume
There are GP2, GP3, IOPS Optimised- io Block, IO1,IO2
 
Diff security group and  NACL
Security Group is the security layer that act as firewall which controls the traffic in and out for the resources in aws
NACL- it is edition layer to the security group  It act as a firewall  which placed on Subnet. To control the traffic in and out for the resources in the subnet
 
IOPS - it is input output operation per second which mean read and write memory operation speed per second it also called as throughput
 
Kubernetes latest version- it is 1.28
 
EKS It is AWS manager Kubernetes service.
 
RDS types engines
 
There are below
Mysql
Postgrasdb
MariaDB
MSSQL
AroraDB
Oracle

Probes in kubernetes
Liveness Probe-
Liveness probes determine whether or not an application running in a container is in a healthy state. If the liveness probe detects an unhealthy state, then Kubernetes kills the container and tries to redeploy it.
Readiness Probe-
Readiness probes determine whether or not a container is ready to serve requests. If the readiness probe returns a failed state, then Kubernetes removes the IP address for the container from the endpoints of all Services.
Startup Probe
A startup probe verifies whether the application within a container is started. Startup probes run before any other probe, and, unless it finishes successfully, disables other probes. If a container fails its startup probe, then the container is killed and follows the pod’s restartPolicy.
 
Taint and toleration

Taints and tolerations are a mechanism that allows you to ensure that pods are not placed on inappropriate nodes. Taints are added to nodes, while tolerations are defined in the pod specification. When you taint a node, it will repel all the pods except those that have a toleration for that taint. A node can have one or many taints associated with it.
 
How to rollback deployment in Kubernetes ?
kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment --to-revision=2


Ho to reduce time to launch instance?
Asg warmup time
Using preconfigured AMI


How to validate error in Helm?
Use the helm lint command. The helm lint command will check the chart for syntax errors and other common problems.
 
How to rollback deployment in helm?
helm rollback release-name -n default revision-number
 
How to destroy all resources keeping specific resource?

terraform destroy -var-file=variables.tf -exclude=my_resource


How to import resource in terraform which is created manually

aws scenario where there are 3 vpvs VPC-A, VPC-B, VPC-C. I have done vpc peering beetween VPC A and B, also vpc peering beetween VPC B and C. in that case can i access resources from VPC A to VPC C?
Yes, For example, if the CIDR block of VPC C is 10.0.0.0/16, you would add a route to the route table for VPC A that points to 10.0.0.0/16 and has the target as the VPC peering connection between VPC A and B.
Once you have added the route to the route table for VPC A, instances in VPC A will be able to access resources in VPC C.
Instances in VPC A can communicate with instances in VPC C through VPC B.

How to give specific Kubernetes resource access to user?
Possible using role and role binding
 
Can i restrict specific resource to use in Kubernetes?
Yes we can , Using ResourceQuota,
To restrict a specific resource, you would create a resource quota with the following fields:
Name: The name of the resource quota.
Scope: The scope of the resource quota. The scope can be a namespace or the entire cluster.
Hard: The hard limit for the resource. This is the maximum amount of the resource that a user or group can consume.
Soft: The soft limit for the resource. This is the recommended amount of the resource that a user or group can consume.
For example, to restrict the amount of CPU that a user can consume in a namespace, you would create a resource quota with the following fields:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: cpu-quota
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: 1
  scope: namespace
What are the target type in AWS?

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
